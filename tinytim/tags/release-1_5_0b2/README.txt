tinyTiM - The tiny Topic Maps engine
====================================

What is tinyTiM?
----------------
tinyTiM is a tiny Topic Maps engine which keeps topic maps in-memory.
This Topic Maps engine is meant to be used together with the TMAPI interfaces,
see <http://www.tmapi.org/> for details.


Installation
------------
No real installation needed, simply put the ``tinytim-<VERSION>.jar`` and
``tmapi-1_0SP1.jar`` into your classpath. That's all. :)
Optionally, you can put the ``trove-<VERSION>.jar`` into your classpath which
makes tinyTiM slightly more memory efficient and faster.
