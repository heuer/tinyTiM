tinyTiM - A tiny Topic Maps engine
==================================

tinyTiM is small, in-memory Topic Maps engine.

Imported from `SourceForge <https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinytim/>` due to sentimental feelings. ;)

Currently, this repository has no advantage over the SVN
repository on SourceForge. The opposite is true.
