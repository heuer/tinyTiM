This section presents some examples how to get started with tinyTiM and TMAPI.
These examples should work with any TMAPI-compatible Topic Maps processor but
the focus stays clearly on tinyTiM.

tinyTiM requires almost no installation since the core Topic Maps engine
was designed to require nothing more than the TMAPI interfaces.

Optional packages like ``mio`` introduce dependencies, though. Anyway,
any TMAPI conformant application should be executable with tinyTiM and the 
TMAPI 1.0SP1 lib in the classpath. If `Trove for Java <http://sourceforge.net/projects/trove4j>`_
is available, tinyTiM will use that library for its collections; this
may enable tinyTiM to use less memory and / or to run faster. But this library represents no
strong dependency, tinyTiM detects it automatically and can be executed without it.

Once tinyTiM and TMAPI is in the classpath the following example should 
work::

    import org.tmapi.core.TopicMapSystemFactory;
    import org.tmapi.core.TopicMapSystem;
    import org.tmapi.core.TopicMap;
    import org.tmapi.core.Topic;
    import org.tmapi.core.TopicName;
    
    TopicMapSystemFactory tmSysFactory = TopicMapSystemFactory.newInstance();
    TopicMapSystem tmSys = tmSysFactory.newTopicMapSystem();
    
    TopicMap tm = tmSys.createTopicMap("http://www.example.org/map1");
    Topic example = tm.createTopic();
    
    TopicName name = example.createName("Example", null);
