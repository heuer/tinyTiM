Welcome to tinyTiM, a small and lightweight in-memory Topic Maps engine

tinyTiM provides a native implementation of the `Topic Maps API (TMAPI) <http://www.tmapi.org/>`_.

It holds everything in-memory, so tinyTiM is reasonable fast and needs no setup; 
just `download <http://sf.net/projects/tinytim>`_ and use it! :)
